### Task Requirements

The assignment was to build a static webpage that strictly adheres to the following criteria:

- [x] **Convert Figma to HTML/CSS:** The entire layout, styling, and structure are based on the provided Figma design files.
- [x] **Pixel-Perfect Design:** Close attention was paid to ensure all measurements, colors, font sizes, and spacing match the design specifications exactly.
- [x] **Fully Fluid Responsive:** The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, from small mobile devices (375px) to large desktops (1440px and beyond), using a mobile-first approach.
- [x] **Clean, Maintainable, and Commented Code:** The code is written using modern best practices, including semantic HTML, BEM-style CSS naming conventions, and clear comments to ensure it is easy to read and understand.

### Features Implemented

- **Semantic HTML5:** The structure is built with semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) for improved accessibility and SEO.
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** The CSS is structured to style for mobile devices first and then progressively enhances the layout for larger screens using media queries.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** A design system for colors, typography, and spacing was established using CSS variables (`:root`) for consistency and easy maintenance.
- **Modern Layout Techniques:** The layout is built primarily with **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to create robust and flexible component and page structures.
- **Interactive Mobile Menu:** The header includes a functional mobile "hamburger" menu built with a small amount of vanilla JavaScript (to be added).
